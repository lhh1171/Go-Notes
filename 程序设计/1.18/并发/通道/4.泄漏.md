# 泄漏

如果通道一直处于阻塞状态，那么会导致 `goroutine` 无法结束和回收，形成资源泄漏。

```go
package main

import (
    "time"
    "runtime"
)

func test() chan byte {
    c := make(chan byte)

    go func() {
        buf := make([]byte, 0, 10<<20) // 10MB
        for {
            d, ok := <- c
            if !ok { return }
            buf = append(buf, d)
        }
    }()

    return c
}

func main() {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        test()
    }

    for {
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
        runtime.GC()
    }
}
```

```bash
# 因 goroutine 无法结束，其持有的 buf 内存无法回收。

$ GODEBUG=gctrace=1 ./test

```go
// src/runtime/runtime2.go

const (
    // G status

    // _Gidle means this goroutine was just allocated and has not
    // yet been initialized.
    _Gidle = iota // 0

    // _Grunnable means this goroutine is on a run queue. It is
    // not currently executing user code. The stack is not owned.
    _Grunnable // 1

    // _Grunning means this goroutine may execute user code. The
    // stack is owned by this goroutine. It is not on a run queue.
    // It is assigned an M and a P (g.m and g.m.p are valid).
    _Grunning // 2

    // _Gsyscall means this goroutine is executing a system call.
    // It is not executing user code. The stack is owned by this
    // goroutine. It is not on a run queue. It is assigned an M.
    _Gsyscall // 3

    // _Gwaiting means this goroutine is blocked in the runtime.
    // It is not executing user code. It is not on a run queue,
    // but should be recorded somewhere (e.g., a channel wait
    // queue) so it can be ready()d when necessary. The stack is
    // not owned *except* that a channel operation may read or
    // write parts of the stack under the appropriate channel
    // lock. Otherwise, it is not safe to access the stack after a
    // goroutine enters _Gwaiting (e.g., it may get moved).
    _Gwaiting // 4

    // _Gmoribund_unused is currently unused, but hardcoded in gdb
    // scripts.
    _Gmoribund_unused // 5

    // _Gdead means this goroutine is currently unused. It may be
    // just exited, on a free list, or just being initialized. It
    // is not executing user code. It may or may not have a stack
    // allocated. The G and its stack (if any) are owned by the M
    // that is exiting the G or that obtained the G from the free
    // list.
    _Gdead // 6

    // _Genqueue_unused is currently unused.
    _Genqueue_unused // 7

    // _Gcopystack means this goroutine's stack is being moved. It
    // is not executing user code and is not on a run queue. The
    // stack is owned by the goroutine that put it in _Gcopystack.
    _Gcopystack // 8

    // _Gpreempted means this goroutine stopped itself for a
    // suspendG preemption. It is like _Gwaiting, but nothing is
    // yet responsible for ready()ing it. Some suspendG must CAS
    // the status to _Gwaiting to take responsibility for
    // ready()ing this G.
    _Gpreempted // 9
)
```

通过添加 `time.After` 之类手段，让通道有解除阻塞的机会。</br>

另外，不当使用 `time.Tick`，也会引发泄漏。
